## Installation

Unzip the package and copy the extention into the folder `ext` of your PHP installation.

After copy, edit the the file `php.ini` and add one line for load the extension depending on your version of PHP (7.0/7.1/7.2/7.3, x64/x86, ZTS/NTS). In example for PHP 7.3 in TS mode and 32 bit architecture : `extension = php_win32service-7.3-ts-vc14-x86.dll` (or use the short name available since PHP 7.2 : `extension = win32service` if the extension file is named `php_win32service.dll`).

Check in command line if the extension is correctly loaded with this command `php --ri win32service`.

If the output indicate this extension is not loaded, check the PHP configuration.

__Note: The PHP version 7.0.0 and 7.1.0 dont work with this extension, use the latest version of PHP 7.0 and PHP 7.1.__

## Use

You can use this [PHP service-library](https://github.com/win32service/service-library) for implements your service runtime and management scripts.

Otherwise , the downloaded zip contains examples scripts used for testing. The file `service.php` contains a skeleton for implement one service in PHP.

To use this example, open a command line window in administrator mode. Go to the example folder and run this command `php service.php create` to installing the test service.

Now a new service is added into the Windows service manager. You can start, stop this service from the Windows service manager or from the administrator command line.

Good coding !
